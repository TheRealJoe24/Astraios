## About The Project

Astraios is a lighweight game engine built from the ground up using lwjgl3.

### Built With

-   [LWJGL3](https://www.lwjgl.org)
-   [PNGDecoder](https://github.com/MatthiasMann/twl/blob/master/src/de/matthiasmann/twl/utils/PNGDecoder.java)

## Getting Started

Get a local copy of the repository with `git clone https://github.com/TheRealJoe24/Astraios.git`


### Prerequisites

-   LWJGL3

    Download and extract the lates release from https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/releases/tag/3.2.3

-   PNGDecoder

    **This depenency will soon be replaced due to licensing concerns.**

    To install, download and add the PNGDecoder source from [PNGDecoder](https://github.com/MatthiasMann/twl/blob/master/src/de/matthiasmann/twl/utils/PNGDecoder.java) to _de.matthiasmann.twl.utils.PNGDecoder.java_ inside the src directory. Alternatively, you can compile the java file separately and import it as a standard user library.

### Installation

Until PNGDecoder is replaced as a dependency, precompiled binaries will not be available.
